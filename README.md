# ElasticDiabetes
Collection of Elastic configs and scripts for indexing my personal diabetes and health data

Each .conf file has to be manually edited for ones own cluster but the configurations are pretty straight forward for anyone with some experience with logstash.

The .conf files are designed to be used with LOGSTASH (elastic.co) and will parse information from Nighstcout or from the scripts provided.

The .pl files are little scripts I wrote (with help from Google) to get data from other sources that are not as user friendly as Nighscout (Google-Fit API)
